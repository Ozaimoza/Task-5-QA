This is a Task 5 QA Virtual Internship Experience, Project create with Bun, ExpressJs, Typescript, Prisma ORM and Postgre

## Getting Started

First, Install Bun Js in your local :

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

Bun Js: [https://bun.sh/docs/installation] (https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

install pakage:

```bash

bun add

```

or

```bash

bun install

```

It's supposed to be the same
bun add came first and that's because most of the CLI for bun install was inspired by yarn v1 since that was what I used before bun install

run the development server:

```bash

bun run dev

```
